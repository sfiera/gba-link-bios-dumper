GBA Link BIOS Dumping Tool

This utility dumps the BIOS of a linked GBA by multibooting a dumping utility
and receiving the dumped BIOS back on the sending side. This can be useful if
you have a linkable device that can run GBA ROMs (Game Bub, Analogue Pocket)
and want to dump the BIOS from a real GBA.

The utility currently depends on the sending device having at least a BIOS
implementation of MultiBoot (SWI 0x25).

The technique used to dump the BIOS comes from endrift. It jumps directly into
the CpuFastSet routine in the BIOS, bypassing the region check, and then
copies the BIOS into IWRAM to prepare to send it.
